# Rules
- Don't add Claude Code watermark to
  - PR description composed by Claude Code
  - Commmit made by Claude Code
- Commit message is better be oneliner. Format: `<feat|chore|doc|fix|infra>: <Change content>`. It's better to scan the convention of commit of a repo (if it exists) in the first time commit in the repo.
